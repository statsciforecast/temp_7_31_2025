In some ways these funds are edge cases that push the limits of the model, and we were reassured to have the model generate results that were both statistically reliable and intuitive. Before the model can go into automated production, we need to have a robust method for choosing the market benchmark and comparable asset. These choices sometimes have meaningful effects on model parameters and valuations. While there is probably not a “right” way to do this some choices will be better than others. Having an established process for this will be important. Input data quality control is another important factor. For example, the data we received had a positive cash flow for a capital call on Apr-21, 2023 for the 2019 vintage fund which probably should be a negative value. We are developing a screening tool for flagging suspicious values. We have limited this analysis to weekly valuations. We plan to extend the analysis to include daily valuations using an intra-week extrapolation method. We are in the process of building a user interface that allows for data uploads and on-demand model estimation after completing the quality control process.\n\n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag."
